//Are fun to be around
I think you're a pretty fun person.
He-he-he, right?
Although I have to say you could be less loud sometimes.
Whaaaat? You could have gotten 100 points if you left that out.
The truth is a double-edged sword.
Indeed, 'tis.

Hmm...
A penny for your thoughts.
Are you going to start speaking in clich√©s now?
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Did the price rise?
I'm just giving you a taste of your own medicine.
Okay, okay, sorry for being loud.
But today was pretty fun, wasn't it?
Oh? I guess it was.
Wouldn't it be nice... if we could do this again?
I mean, not going to the grocery store. Just going somewhere together.
...
I mean, not as a couple or anything! Just as friends.
Oh, oh, ah-ha-ha-ha, I see! A-as friends! Of course!
So, what do you think?
--Sure
--No way
