Nathan (Jonathan Adams)
October 19
An extremely average teenager (or so he likes to describe himself). In reality, he is actually slightly below average. Not that it matters, as wherever he goes his presence is seldom noted. Or a Sunday afternoon, he just wants to lie around and read his favorite novels.
171cm 5'7"

Catie (Catherine Adams)
October 19
160cm 5'3"

Mary (Mary Van Buren)
December 5
For how she usually acts, she is surprisingly popular (or maybe that's why?). It may seem unlikely, but everything she does is entirely natural and sincere. On a Sunday afternoon, she just wants to play her favorite handheld games.
Likes: Cute things
Dislikes: Lying
156cm 5'1"

Link (Arthur Lindmark)
Chivalrous. Most people find him intimidating at first, but are quickly won over by his selfless personality. Has never lost in arm wrestling. 
189cm 6'2"

Hal (Richard Henry Lee)
Gallant
175cm 5'9"

Jan (Jane Van Buren)
Tall, over-bearing
