Jonathan Adams
October 19
An extremely average teenager (or so he likes to describe himself). In reality, he is actually slightly below average. Not that it matters, as wherever he goes his presence is seldom noted. Or a Sunday afternoon, he just wants to lie around and read his favorite novels.

Mary Van Buren
December 5
For how she usually acts, she is surprisingly popular (or maybe that's why?). It may seem unlikely, but everything she does is entirely natural and sincere. On a Sunday afternoon, she just wants to play her favorite handheld games.
