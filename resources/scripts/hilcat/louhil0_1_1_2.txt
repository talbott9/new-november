//No, thanks!
No, thanks!
...I'll see you later, then.
Cat, where are you going?
Huh?
I'll go with you. You're so cute and small you need someone to protect you.
B-But...
Let's-a-go-go!

So you were heading to the grocery store. I'm glad I decided to accompany you.
This is a very dangerous place.
.......
Look at these coconuts. Do you know how many people are killed by falling coconuts a year?
No...
It's more than sharks.
Can we buy the eggs I need already?

...Are you even carrying enough money to buy all this ramen?
You bet! I just got my allowance.
Oh, that counter is free.
Cash or card?
I'm paying with cash. Please give me a second...

Thank you, Cat! I was supposed to protect you, but I guess you ended up being the one to protect me.
D-Don't mention it.
Hug of gratitude!
Eek!
I can't believe I'm friends with such a cutie!
F-Friends?
Huh? Are we not friends?
Friends... 
Yes, we're friends.
Yay! Cheek rub of friendship!
Eek!
Never mind, we're not friends! Stop!
