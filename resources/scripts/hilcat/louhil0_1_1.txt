//Ask her to say it again
I'll let you go if you say it one more time.
W-What? But that's embarrassing...
Then I guess I'll just carry you home with me.
W-Wait, I'll say it!
Yay!
Sigh...
......
M-Meow.
Ahahahaaa! Cute, cute, cute!
Ow! Didn't you say you'd let me go?
O-Oh, right. Sorry!
Sigh...
Sorry, I got a bit carried away.
Are you like this at school, too? No wonder Nate's always complaining about you.
He is? What did he say about me?
...Do you want to know?
--Yes, please!
--No, thanks!
