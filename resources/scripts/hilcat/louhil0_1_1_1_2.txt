//Cut my hair short
I'm going to cut my hair short, like in those romance mangas.
...M-Mangas?
When you have your heart broken, you have to cut your hair. That's a rule.
Are you heartbroken?
No, but I'll do it just in case.
I don't get it...
Here's a comb and clippers.
Huh? Do you want me to cut it for you? (Why was she carrying this...)
I've never cut my hair before, so I don't know how to do it...
Hold it!
?!
Link?!
Mary! Are you really fine with this?
Let it be known that all women look better with long hair, and that the loss of hair always accompanies the loss of beauty.
Is that so...?
But the mangas...
Confound the decadent literature of our age! A woman's hair is her life, and you've been blessed with a plentitude of it.
To cut it without further thought, is to cut your ties with all virtues!
Hold it!
?! ?!
Hal?!
Link, as usual, you have no eye for true beauty. You focus too much on externalities, you hard-headed fool.
True beauty lies within, and any girl that is willing to cut her hair for her loved one is to be cherished as a most precious jewel.
Henry...!
If the hair is a covering, may I ask what it covers, if not the face?
For that reason, I say it is an obstacle that must be removed before beauty in its full splendor may be gazed upon!
Grr...
...What are you guys talking about?
Stand back, fair maiden. I fear this discussion has reached an impasse that may only be resolved through an honorable duel.
W-What?
He means we're having a throw-down.
Wait, are you fighting?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Again?
Yep.
Indeed.
But fighting is bad.
So?
And?
...Do you want me to call my sister?
W-What? You'll call Jane?
.......
.......
W-Well, the length of a woman's hair is not so important in the grand scheme of things.
R-Right! Short, long, who's to say they're wrong? The best we can do is move along!
He's rhyming out of fear...
