//Commit seppuku
I'll commit sudoku.
...Do you mean seppuku?
No, sudoku. I'll play a match of sudoku.
Match? It's a single-player game...
I'll play a match of sudoku with Jonathan, that way I'll know his true feelings!
Are you listening...?

Jonathan!
Huh? Mary?
I have come! To challenge! You! 
......
To a game of! Sudoku!
Cate?
I-I'm just coming along!
What will it be, Adams? Will you accept my challenge?
...Adams?
Only those may shoot, who are also prepared to be shot.
Cate?
I-I know nothing about this!
...Well, whatever. You'll go away after we play sudoku, right?
Fight, or perish!
Sure, I'll do it.

(Damn, he's good!)
(This woman... She's no ordinary sudoku player!)
(But I have something to protect... I can't lose here!)
(No matter... I'm the competitive sudoku world champion for a reason, and I won't lose to some stupid girl.)
(...Should I leave?)
--God of sudoku, lend me thy power!
--God of sudoku, why has thou forsaken me?
