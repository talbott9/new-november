//Cease and desist
Actually, never mind.
Huh?
I'm not in the mood for that. Something bad happened today.
W-What happened?
My pet hamster died.
He climbed into the washing machine while I was at school.
Oh...
We only found him after my mom took out the clothes to dry.
He must have been there for hours... spinning...
......
......
M-Maybe it had fun before it died, at least?
......
......
D-D-Did you hear about the new pet store that just opened?
Pet store?
W-Why don't we go take a look? Maybe we can even get you a new p-pet!
Okay...

Look at this kitty! Isn't she cute?
Meow~
I guess...
This puppy's adorable, too!
Woof, woof!

W-Which one do you like more? Cats or dogs?
