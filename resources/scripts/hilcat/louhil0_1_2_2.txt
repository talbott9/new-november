//Frogs
I like frogs.
F-Frogs?!
Is that weird? They're cute.
C-Cute...
Those big round eyes... That smooth vibrant skin...
......
C-Cat? Is there something wrong? You don't look well.
N-No, I'm fine! G-Go on.
Erm, okay, then...
Forgive me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation.
I've brought over a couple of frog specimens so you can take a look at them.
Wow, they sell frogs here! Isn't that great, Cat?
Big brother, help!!
Wait, Cat! Where are you going?!
