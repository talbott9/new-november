You were going to kiss me just like in those corny school romance dramas!
A melodramatic track would play during the entire scene, while the hero and heroine confess their feelings to each other...
"Heroine, I love you!"
"What took you so long, Hero? I love you, too!"
They draw each other into a loving embrace...
Then the credits roll as we stare at their black silhouettes outlined against the redâ€“orange sunset...
Directed by Michael Bay.
Bravo!
Thanks.

I don't mind it if it's on the cheek.

Never mind! See you at school tomorrow!
Thanks! Bye!

Let's go home.
