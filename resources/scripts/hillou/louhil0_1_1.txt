Isaac Newton?

Or was he the guy who wrote 'Crime and Punishment?' I always get them mixed up.

Okay, maybe my grades are slightly below average.
Shouldn't you be heading to the grocery store?
What?! How did you know?!
I heard you singing it. The grocery song.
Geez, you heard that? That's embarrassing.
And you? Where are you going?
...To the grocery store.
What a coincidence! Let's go together, then!
I'd rather not...
Why?
Well...
.........
Fine, I'll go.
Yay!
Don't make a fuss about it.

Chicken... Beef... Bacon...
Oh, there it is! My favorite! Soy sauce-flavored ramen!
......
I don't remember the last time I bought the other flavors. Soy sauce is just better.
For example, chicken ramen doesn't taste like chicken at all. I don't know why they named it that.
......
Bacon gets close to tasting like bacon, but not quite. I don't like it. I think they call that the "uncanny valley."
Beef is fine, I suppose. It's kind of neutral. But it doesn't taste like beef, either.

Are you going to buy eggs or ramen? Choose one.
