Sorry, Mom... but I like ramen more than anything else.
I was only speaking rhetorically, you know. You can buy both.
But then my love for ramen will seem insincere!
...Who cares?
Nissin Foods.
Well, I guess they would care.
What's your favorite brand?
I don't have one.
I guess I'll get this one, then.
Okay.

Look! Isn't the sunset beautiful?
......
What's with the face?
That's just what my face looks like.
Why are you making that expression?
Because I'm carrying fifty packets of ramen for a stranger.
I'm not a stranger! Besides, didn't I tell you you can take two of them?
I don't like soy sauce...
Why didn't you say that earlier? Then I would've gotten the other flavors.
I don't like ramen either...
What do you like?
Tuna.
What else?
Peanut butter.
What else?
Cheese.
Okay, then I'll make you a tuna-peanut-butter-cheese sandwich.
..........
That sounds delicious.
Right?
