We're friends!
Classmates.
I entered your house, so now we're friends.
There's no such rule.
Yes, there is.
No, there isn't.
Why did you invite me into your house if you don't think of me as a friend?
I didn't invite you.
Oh, right.
Oh, that's a shame. I think you'd make a cute couple.
I don't think so.
I don't think so, either.
I think that's the first time our thoughts matched.
We'd make a super-duper cute couple!
Can you keep it down? I can't read with all this noise.
Wait, is that a girl?
Why are you so surprised?
Didn't you say you'd tell me when you got a girlfriend?
I didn't.
Well, then when I get a boyfriend I won't tell you, either. What do you think of that?
Nothing.
What do you mean, 'nothing?'
Um... Are you Jonathan's sister?
Yeah, so? Who are you?
I'm Mary van Buren, Jonathan's classmate! Nice to meet you!
C-Classmate? You're not his girlfriend?
Of course she's not.
U-Ugh, that's embarrassing...
I'm really sorry. Don't think of him any worse for this.
--Ask her name
--Hug her

Please to be your acquaintance

Get out of my house.

I entered your house, so now we're friends.
There's no such rule.
Yes, there is. And then when I go into your room I'll be your best friend.
