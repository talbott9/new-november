That's right, we've been dating for over a month now.
Well, that puts a burden off my shoulders!
There's a frightening amount of old bachelors in our family, you see. I think it's in the blood.
I've been worried for a long time little Nate would be the next victim of the curse.
That won't happen on my watch! He said he's going to marry me as soon as we graduate!
I never said that, and we aren't dating.
Please don't be offended, he's always been like that.
Far from it. That's one of his charms.
I'll kick you out!
