I'm going to do a hand stand!
You're wearing a skirt.
Oh, right. Never mind.
What's some other way I could show my gratitude, then?
I don't think you need to do anything.
I see, so just my presence is already enough thanks.
Nobody said that.
He-he-he.
Good grief.

Oh, my house is that way.
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
Bye! See you at school!
Later.
La-la-la! ♪ Going home! ♪
