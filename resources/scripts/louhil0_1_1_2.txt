//they're the same
They're the same thing.
That's why I'm asking.
I don't know what you mean.
Well, let me put it like this.
Suppose the brown eggs were really better than the white eggs. Do you think anyone would buy the latter?
......
Yes.
That's right. Some people will always choose the white eggs regardless of what others say, since white is a more pleasant color than brown.
Since it would incredibly complicated to prove a brown egg's superiority over a white egg without advanced lab equipment, they judge them by their external appearance.
I'd say they're almost right to trust their own perception over information that they can't empirically prove or disprove.
I see...
My mom likes the white ones, so that's what I'll get.
I'll do the same, then.

Look! Isn't the sunset beautiful?
......
What's with the face?
That's just what my face looks like.
Why are you making that expression?
Because I'm carrying fifty packets of ramen for a stranger.
I'm not a stranger! Besides, didn't I tell you you can take two of them?
I don't like soy sauce...
Oh. Then I'll give you four.
I think that's the wrong operation.
One?
That's division.
Four.
That's what you just said.
Well, what could you possibly want that's not soy sauce ramen, then?
......
-Give me a kiss
-Give me a tuna sandwich

All right. I want you to go by 'Saucy Mol' for a week.
What's that mean?
It's short for 'Mary.'
