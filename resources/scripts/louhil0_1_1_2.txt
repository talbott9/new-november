//Have nice hair
You have some pretty nice hair.
He-he-he, right? I put a lot of effort into it.
I can see it. I can't think of anyone with better hair.
Wait... I guess there's my sister.
What? Chrissy? Well, I guess her hair is nice...
Oh, I know. Do you want to touch it?
Huh? You mean your hair?
You can't tell which one's better just by looking at it. You have to use all of your senses, see.
But...
Here, take it.
Ah? Okay.
...
(Hmm... This is actually not bad. Has a silky texture to it.)
So?
(So this is what girls' hair feels like?)
Jonathan?
A-ah, well, I guess it feels nice.
And? Who won?
Dunno. I haven't touched my sister's hair since middle school.
What? I thought siblings were supposed to be always together doing stuff?
Oh, I forgot you don't have siblings.
I wish I had a cute little sister...
It's not all good things, you know. Sometimes I wish I didn't have siblings.
But can you tell me with a straight face that you'd rather not have a cute little sister?
........................................No.
Wait till Chrissy hears this.
What?!
