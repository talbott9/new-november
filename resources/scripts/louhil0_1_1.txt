//Grocery store
There's a grocery store down the street, isn't there? I think I saw your mom there sometimes.
All right, target acquired! Let's-a-go-go!
Please don't act like this when we're there.
//Transition to grocery
We have arrived! Surrender your booty!
O-ho-ho! 'Tis a fine pudding we have here, quite worthy of plunder.
What thinkst thou, boatswain?
What happened to my captain rank? Also, you pronounced that wrong.
Oh, have you started to get into it?
There's the dairy section. What egg color does your mom prefer?
Huh? Now that you mention it, I don't really know. Most of the time I only see the eggs when they're already cooked.
Don't you ever help out at home or anything?
My mom doesn't like me to help out for some reason. She says I have the opposite of Midas' touch.
Well, then we'll just get the white ones. Here.
What about you? Do you help out a lot?
I guess so. I don't like leaving everything to my parents. Makes me sort of guilty.
That's pretty nice of you.
I think it's normal.
That's what's nice about you, dummy.
Are you... complimenting me?
Yea, sailor.
Well, I guess you also... Hmm...
--Are fun to be around
--Have pretty hair
