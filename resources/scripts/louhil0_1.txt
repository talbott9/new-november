Oh, Jonathan spotted.
Why are you speaking of me like you just saw a rare car brand during a roadtrip?
You use brands for that game? In my family, we use colors.
So, what are you doing here?
Errand, sir.
Could it be... eggs?
What?! How'd you know?!
C-calm down, it's just a guess.
Phew... I thought you could read my mind for a second.
No one could read your mind.
Since you're here, let's go together!
All right, what way should we go?
What do you mean 'what way'? Do you not know where the grocery is?
Well, there's more than one, isn't there? So, which one?
--Grocery store
--Egg store
