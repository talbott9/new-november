Gooooooooooood!
After!
Noon!

Who are you?
What?! Have you forgotten me already? It's Mary, Mary van Buren! We talked earlier in the day!
I can't remember every single classmate's name. The school year's just started.
It started a month ago!
So, it did.
Because I'm merciful, I'm willing to forgive your outrageous lack of delicacy for the measly price of one Snickers bar. So, pay up.
That's hardly a merciful tone.
Can you at least give a quarter? Then I can buy it at the vending machine.
Is that enough to buy it?
No, that's how much I'm short.
Ah...
What?
I forgot. I'm supposed to go to the grocery store right now.
You mean that grocery store? I don't think they sell Mars bars.
Didn't you say you wanted Snickers?
Did I? Well, I won't complain if you want to buy me both.
What are you even doing here?
Ah...
........
I forgot. I'm supposed to go to the grocery store, too.
I see...
We ran out of eggs, so my mom asked to buy some.
......
And you? What are you going to buy?
--Eggs

Let's go to the supermarket instead. They sell everything there.
Why are you coming along... Well, whatever.
--Go to the grocery store
