You were going to kiss me, just like in those corny school romance dramas!
A melodramatic track would play during the entire scene, while the hero and heroine confess their feelings to each other...
"Heroine, I love you!"
"What took you so long, Hero? I love you, too!"
They draw each other into a loving embrace...
Then the credits would roll as we stare at their black silhouettes outlined against the redâ€“orange sunset. The End.
Bravo!
Thank you, thank you...
