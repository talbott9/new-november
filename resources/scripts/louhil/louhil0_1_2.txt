I'm looking for a new plastic model kit.
You mean those miniature models of boats you assemble from little parts?
Yes.
Do they sell those at the grocery store?
I don't think so.
That reminds me, have you heard of the new store they opened recently?
New store?
Yes, I heard they sell all kinds of weird stuff there. They probably have plastic models too.
Have you been there yet?
No, but that's what now is for!
Let's-a-go-go!

That's the sketchiest store I've ever seen.
Really? It looks pretty normal to me.
Are you sure they sell anything here?
Honestly, I don't know.
As long as we came all this way, we might as well go in.
Okay!
Konnichiwelcome!

Good afternoon! Would you happen to sell any plastic model kits?
Yes!
Great! Can we see them?
No!
