//Eggs
Actually, I'm going to buy eggs as well.
Perfect! Let's go together, then. I know a good store.

Chicken... Beef... Bacon...
Oh, there it is! My favorite! Soy sauce-flavored ramen!
......
I don't remember the last time I bought the other flavors. Soy sauce is just better.
For example, chicken ramen doesn't taste like chicken at all. I don't know why they named it that.
......
Bacon gets close to tasting like bacon, but not quite. I don't like it. I think they call that the "uncanny valley."
Beef is fine, I suppose. It's kind of neutral. But it doesn't taste like beef, either.
......
Soy sauce banzai!
Didn't you say you were going to buy eggs?
Oh, right, I almost forgot.
Do you prefer the brown or white eggs?
--White
--They're the same
