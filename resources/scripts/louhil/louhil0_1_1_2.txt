//they're the same
They're the same thing.
That's why I'm asking.
I don't know what you mean.
/*Well, let me put it like this.
Suppose the brown eggs were really healthier than the white eggs. Do you think anyone would buy the latter?
......
Yes.
That's right. Some people will always choose the white eggs regardless of what others since they prefer how they look externally.
Since it would incredibly complicated to prove a brown egg's superiority over a white egg without advanced lab equipment, they judge them by their appearance.
I'd say they're almost right to trust their own perception over information that they can't empirically prove or disprove.
I see...
My mom likes the white ones, so that's what I'll get.
I'll get the brown ones, then.
Hey.
*/
I don't know what you mean, either. They're clearly different colors.
Do you pick the white or black pieces in chess?
White. They have a strategical advantage since they move first.
Why do you know that?
My sister plays chess. She's really good, too.
We'll get the white eggs, then.
Okey-doke!

Look! Isn't the sunset beautiful?
......
What's with the face?
That's just what my face looks like.
Why are you making that expression?
Because I'm carrying fifty packets of ramen for a stranger.
I'm not a stranger! Besides, didn't I tell you you can take two of them?
I don't like soy sauce...
Oh. Then I'll give you four.
I think that's the wrong operation.
One?
That's division.
Four.
That's what you just said.
Well, what do you want that's not shoyu ramen, then?
-Give me a kiss
-Give me a tuna sandwich
